    <h2>Me: Jordan Postak</h2>
    <h4>I'm the guy on the left. The beautiful Bolivian on the right is my wife.</h4>
    <h6>Seriously, I'm usually an introvert...</h6>
    <p>Well, I'm excited to be taking this course! This is the beginning of my new career.</p> 
    <p>So, who am I?</p>
    <p>I'm 37 and I'm from Ogden Utah. I'm married to my eternal amor. She is my Bolivian, and I love her dearly. We have a 14 year old son. We also have a Schnoodle. She is very sweet and gentle. Our little family has been together for almost 5 years, with the exclusion of the puppy, who was added a little over a year ago.</p>
    <p>I got the BYU Pathway Connect Certificate! I plan to continue on to get a Bachelors in Applied Technology with 3 Certificates; Web Development, Web and Computer Programming, and Software Development. This is going to be awesome!</p>
